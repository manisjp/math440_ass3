So to run this you could either type out the command, 
'mpiexec -machinefile lab_ma_file -np 4 ./main_exe 2'
or you could type './run.sh'. I created the 'run.sh' file simply because I was too lazy to type out
the above command over and over again. To change the number of cores used and the value of J, either
edit 'run.sh' or type the correct command. Either way will work though. Otherwise everything else
you need should be within 'Writeup.pdf'.
